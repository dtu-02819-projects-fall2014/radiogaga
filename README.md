=========
Demo at http://83.92.40.216/ (in developing)

This project is for the final exam in cource 02819 Datamining with Python at DTU 2014. The project is made by Rasmus Jessen Aaskov, SÃ¸ren Trads Steen and Joachim Blom Hansen. 

## About the project
In this project we analyse songs played in the radio using different machine learning tools. Currently, only danish broadcasting station is used (as an example), but the code can be used for other countries as well.  The tools used in this project is (among others), MySQL, nltk and scikit-learn. For presentation purpose we have set up a private webserver (LAMP) at http://83.92.40.216/ which provide the visual result and the machine learning analysis.
